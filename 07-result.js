// --- Day 7: Handy Haversacks ---
// You land at the regional airport in time for your next flight. In fact, it looks like you'll even have time to grab some food: all flights are currently delayed due to issues in luggage processing.

// Due to recent aviation regulations, many rules (your puzzle input) are being enforced about bags and their contents; bags must be color-coded and must contain specific quantities of other color-coded bags. Apparently, nobody responsible for these regulations considered how long they would take to enforce!

// For example, consider the following rules:

// light red bags contain 1 bright white bag, 2 muted yellow bags.
// dark orange bags contain 3 bright white bags, 4 muted yellow bags.
// bright white bags contain 1 shiny gold bag.
// muted yellow bags contain 2 shiny gold bags, 9 faded blue bags.
// shiny gold bags contain 1 dark olive bag, 2 vibrant plum bags.
// dark olive bags contain 3 faded blue bags, 4 dotted black bags.
// vibrant plum bags contain 5 faded blue bags, 6 dotted black bags.
// faded blue bags contain no other bags.
// dotted black bags contain no other bags.
// These rules specify the required contents for 9 bag types. In this example, every faded blue bag is empty, every vibrant plum bag contains 11 bags (5 faded blue and 6 dotted black), and so on.

// You have a shiny gold bag. If you wanted to carry it in at least one other bag, how many different bag colors would be valid for the outermost bag? (In other words: how many colors can, eventually, contain at least one shiny gold bag?)

// In the above rules, the following options would be available to you:

// A bright white bag, which can hold your shiny gold bag directly.
// A muted yellow bag, which can hold your shiny gold bag directly, plus some other bags.
// A dark orange bag, which can hold bright white and muted yellow bags, either of which could then hold your shiny gold bag.
// A light red bag, which can hold bright white and muted yellow bags, either of which could then hold your shiny gold bag.
// So, in this example, the number of bag colors that can eventually contain at least one shiny gold bag is 4.

// How many bag colors can eventually contain at least one shiny gold bag? (The list of rules is quite long; make sure you get all of it.)

// To begin, get your puzzle input.

// --- Part Two ---
// It's getting pretty expensive to fly these days - not because of ticket prices, but because of the ridiculous number of bags you need to buy!

// Consider again your shiny gold bag and the rules from the above example:

// faded blue bags contain 0 other bags.
// dotted black bags contain 0 other bags.
// vibrant plum bags contain 11 other bags: 5 faded blue bags and 6 dotted black bags.
// dark olive bags contain 7 other bags: 3 faded blue bags and 4 dotted black bags.
// So, a single shiny gold bag must contain 1 dark olive bag (and the 7 bags within it) plus 2 vibrant plum bags (and the 11 bags within each of those): 1 + 1*7 + 2 + 2*11 = 32 bags!

// Of course, the actual rules have a small chance of going several levels deeper than this example; be sure to count all of the bags, even if the nesting becomes topologically impractical!

// Here's another example:

// shiny gold bags contain 2 dark red bags.
// dark red bags contain 2 dark orange bags.
// dark orange bags contain 2 dark yellow bags.
// dark yellow bags contain 2 dark green bags.
// dark green bags contain 2 dark blue bags.
// dark blue bags contain 2 dark violet bags.
// dark violet bags contain no other bags.
// In this example, a single shiny gold bag must contain 126 other bags.

// How many individual bags are required inside your single shiny gold bag?
